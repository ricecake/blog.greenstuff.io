Acquire kidney beans, black beans, potatoes, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, black pepper, cooking oil, rice, and optionally cumin and cinnamon. Add one half part kidney beans, one half part black beans, and four parts water into a large pot. Bring the water to a strong boil, and then stir, and reduce to a simmer. Allow to simmer while covered. Before you add the water, make sure to sort through the beans for stones, goya brand beans have a problem with that.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>
I don&amp;rsquo;t know what you&amp;rsquo;re expecting. I think about things, and then I try to write them down. This is where I thought I might try doing that, since writing is a good way to clarify ideas.
Enjoy?</description></item></channel></rss>
