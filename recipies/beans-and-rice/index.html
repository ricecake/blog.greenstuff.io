Bring the water to a strong boil, and then stir, and reduce to a simmer. Allow to simmer while covered. Before you add the water, make sure to sort through the beans for stones, goya brand beans have a problem with that.</li><li>Do something else for fifteen to twenty minutes, and then return to the pot and stir the beans. If the water has lowered in volume significantly, replace it, increase heat to boil, and then reduce back to simmer. Repeat this step for about one hour.</li><li>At this point, take approximately two to three parts potato, and cut them into small chunks. Add these chunks to the pot, and continue to boil for about one and a half more hours, or until the beans are tender. A good sign that this has happened is that a small selection of the beans will have had their skins split.</li><li>This is the point where the recipe becomes slightly more labor intensive for about 20-30 minutes. Add about four to five parts water to the pot, depending on if you want the dish to come out more watery, or more firm. You need at least three parts to ensure that the rice can cook properly though.</li><li>Increase the heat to full, and while the new water is coming up to temperature, add a hearty portion of cooking oil, approximately enough that the surface of the water is 85% coated. Not too much though, or else it&rsquo;s weird.</li><li>Add one part rice to the mix, and stir firmly for about a minute. You want everything to get slightly oily, and cause the oil to break up into small little droplets. It will look pretty.</li><li>At this point, you have reached the seasoning stage. Be vaguely swift in this, and take time to stir on occasion, as rice the adheres to the bottom of the pot is dippy.</li><li>Add a significant amount of garlic powder. You can&rsquo;t really have too much I&rsquo;ve decided. Add a significant amount of salt as well, as it helps the carbohydrates in the dish break down in a palatable fashion. Add a slightly smaller amount of onion powder. You want the flavor to be more subtle than the garlic, in my opinion. Do the same for the black pepper. The rice wont be done cooking yet, so you can&rsquo;t taste it to make sure the flavor is right, but smelling it and tasting the broth can give a good indication of where it&rsquo;s going. Be really, really, really conservative if you decide to venture into the land of cinnamon and cumin, as they will hit a carbohydrate based dish like a fire hose. 1/5th the amount of either compared to garlic powder will mask it almost entirely.</li><li>Stir continuously until such time as the rice is cooked and the consistency has settled to the desired level. It should smell yummy.</li><li>remove from heat.</li><li>Eat. Repeat as needed.</li></ol></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><a href=/ class=logo style=text-decoration:none><span class=logo__mark><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="greater-icon" viewBox="0 0 44 44"><path fill="none" d="M15 8l14.729 14.382L15 35.367"/></svg></span><span class=logo__text>greenstuff -v</span>
