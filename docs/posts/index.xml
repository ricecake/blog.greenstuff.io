          Regular expressions are two things:
 A tool for describing patterns in strings Frequently maligned and misunderstood  Hopefully, if you learn more about how they&amp;rsquo;re helpful for the first point, the second point will become less true.
(?:Opinion)+ I&amp;rsquo;m not going to try to explain regex comprehensively, or all the different ways that people like to do them. The point of this article is to tell you how I go about producing them, and what I would expect out of a regex that I was looking at in a code review.

          A brief history of what I&amp;rsquo;m even going on about. I&amp;rsquo;ve got this idea for how to automatically classify and produce a matching algorithm for an unbounded stream of small strings with slight differences, and I think it might be fun to detail how it all works.
How it started So, a while ago I was working on a project that involved needing to collect and classify automated emails. The we decided to classify them based on their subject lines, which tended to be similar, but had minor differences:

Don&amp;rsquo;t know that I truely understand the begging, but at least it got the conclusion right.
